                <p>It all started one misty morning in a COTTAGE. Or maybe it did not.</p>
                <p>Behold, a limited selection of ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL and NON-ESSENTIAL recipes of food that you can make</p>
                <img src = "../Images/shape_food.jpg" alt = "an image">
                <p>To make food, you need ingredients.</p>
                <p>Ingredients are just other food.
                    You make food kind of like how you produce super complicated software. You use lots of little software to make a big software.
                    If you do it well then you will make something nice. 
                </p>
                <p>Take wisdom from this vast array of a few recipes and maybe one day you'll be almost but not quite as good a chef as me (unlikely).</p>
